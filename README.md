# A simple Astro boilerplate with CUBE CSS and TailwindCSS


## Introduction

This project is a boilerplate designed to kickstart your development process. It combines the power of [Astro](https://astro.build/), a web framework for content-driven websites, [Cube CSS](https://cube.fyi/), a pragmatic and simple CSS methodology, [Every Layouts](https://every-layout.dev/), for better, more resilient CSS, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework used as utility-second. It also incorporates design tokens for consistent styling. The project uses pnpm for efficient package management.

By using this boilerplate, you can leverage the benefits of these technologies right from the start, without the hassle of setting them up individually. This can significantly speed up your development process, ensure code quality, and ultimately lead to a better end product. It's perfect for teams that value efficiency, performance, and modern development practices.
